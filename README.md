# Dynamic-Branch-Predictor-Simulator

Language: C++

• Developed a trace-driven simulator to model gshare, bimodal and hybrid branch predictors with a configurable set-associative branch target buffer(BTB).

• Evaluated the trade-off between miss prediction rate and predictor cost in bits using SPEC95 benchmark suite and estimated the best design configuration based on them.
